# EcoStar Pro: Smart Energy and Resource Consumption Management System

## Project Overview
EcoStar Pro is a cross-platform desktop application developed using Python and Kivy that enables households and small businesses to monitor and manage their electricity, gas, and water consumption in real-time. The app provides detailed insights, personalized recommendations, and actionable tips to help users optimize resource usage, reduce utility bills, and contribute to environmental sustainability.

## Features
- Real-time tracking of electricity, gas, and water consumption in a unified interface.
- Secure user authentication and personalized dashboards.
- Detailed consumption history with selectable timeframes (daily, weekly, monthly).
- Actionable recommendations for saving energy and resources.
- Modular architecture for easy maintenance, scalability, and future feature expansion.
- Cross-platform deployment with consistent user experience on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- Future AI integration planned for predictive analytics and anomaly detection.

## Technology Stack
- Programming Language: Python
- Framework: Kivy for cross-platform GUI development
- Database: SQLite for local data storage
- Planned: Machine Learning models (LSTM, Isolation Forest) for AI capabilities

## Installation and Usage
1. Ensure Python 3.8 or higher is installed.
2. Install dependencies:
# pip install -r requirments.txt
3. Run the application:

## python main.py
4. Follow on-screen instructions to create user profiles and start tracking consumption.
